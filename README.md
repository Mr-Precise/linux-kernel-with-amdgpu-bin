## linux kernel for 64bit (amd64) with latest amdgpu drivers.

Driver work checked on AMD Radeon HD 7750 (Cape Verde PRO, GCN 1.0), but will probably work on others.

Vulkan API - ok

Hardware decode video - ok

This linux kernel compiled on Linux Ubuntu 20.04, but will probably run on Debian.

To get the best Vulkan performance recommended for use with *ubuntu PPA repo https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/graphics-drivers

This is an **very** experimental kernel, use at your own risk.
